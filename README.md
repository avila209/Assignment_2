# Assignment_2

Equations:
Start Time: Time the process started.
Finish Time: Time the process finished - Time the process arrived.
Total Time: Current time of program when the process fully completed.
Response Time: Time the process started - Time the process arrived.

	Step 1: Open terminal in linux
	Step 2: Enter “git clone https://github.com/avila209/Assignment_2” into terminal
  	Step 3: Drag and Drop test.dat files into the same folder as cloned repository where main.cpp is found.
  	Step 4: Replace dat file filename with sample-jobs.dat. Alternatively, you can launch a  terminal session from inside the directory 		    the main.cpp file is located in and run the command “nano main.cpp” to edit Line 15 of our code to the file name of your 		     test dat files.
	        Ex. Line 15:	ifstream file ("sample-jobs.dat");
	Step 5: Enter “g++ main.cpp - o main” into terminal.
	Step 6: Enter “./main” in terminal to the program.
  	Step 7: Program will display all requested outputs based on scheduler after the time quantum is given.
